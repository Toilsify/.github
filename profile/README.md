##What we are doing 🙋‍

Getting a place to release diabolic substances from the body in an unplanned environment can be really frustrating and embarrassing.

This is a major problem faced by several individuals with different faced experiences. This calls for a need for a solution to this human-faced problem of accessing public toilets around several locations and routing humans to that location.

We will be helping faced users with the solution of tracking available public toilets around them  

In the future goals, it is planned that the solution will help create affordable public toilets to area of more demand.

🌈 We are currently creating a solution that allows users to find public toilets around them. 

🌱 We are using web technologies that will simplify human living and promoting [SDG GOALS](https://www.google.com/search?client=opera&q=sdg+goals+list&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8).

👯 We are looking to collaborate with other open-source developers to add more features to this web app.

💬 You can reach out to us on github about any [issues](https://github.com/Toilsify/Toilsify/issues)

🍿 Fun fact: This idea was generated in a toilet.. 😂
